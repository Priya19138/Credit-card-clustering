# Credit-card-clustering
This project aims to create a cluster of customers with similar credit card spending patterns, providing valuable insights for credit card companies. It will use Python libraries and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and identify customer segments.

To execute this project, we will first gather a dataset of credit card transactions using a web scraping tool. The data will then be cleaned, missing values handled, and features scaled to prepare it for analysis. We will analyze the data, identify relevant features, and visualize it to uncover hidden patterns. Next, we will apply clustering algorithms such as K-means Clustering and DBSCAN to group customers based on their spending behavior. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the clustering model and optimize it for better results.

This clustering system has several real-world applications. Credit card companies can use the tool to identify distinct customer segments with similar spending patterns, which helps in providing personalized offers, targeted marketing campaigns, and customer retention strategies. Fraud detection agencies can use it to detect anomalous spending behavior, indicating potential fraudulent transactions. Additionally, banks and financial institutions can use it to understand the spending habits of their customer segments, offering tailored rewards programs, financial planning advice, and credit card adjustments.

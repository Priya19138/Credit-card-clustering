# Credit-card-clustering
#This project aims to create a cluster of customers with similar credit card spending patterns, providing valuable insights for credit card companies. It will use Python libraries and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and identify customer segments.

#**What It Takes to Execute This Project**
#Gather a dataset of credit card transactions using a web scraping tool.
#Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features to prepare the data for analysis.
#Analyze the data, identify features, and visualize data for a better understanding of hidden patterns.
#Apply clustering algorithms like K-means Clustering and DBSCAN to group customers based on their spending behavior.
#Evaluate the performance of the clustering model and optimize it for better results.
#**Real World Applications**
#Credit card companies can use the tool to identify distinct customer segments with similar spending patterns, aiding in personalized offers, targeted marketing campaigns, and customer retention strategies.
#Fraud detection agencies can use it to detect anomalous spending behavior, indicating potential fraudulent transactions.
#Banks and financial institutions can use it to understand the spending habits of their customer segments, offering tailored rewards programs, financial planning advice, and credit card adjustments.
